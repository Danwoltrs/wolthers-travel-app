# MEMORY.md - Receipt Scanning UI Improvements

## Current Status - December 2024

### What We Just Implemented
1. **Switched from OpenAI Vision to Google Vision API**
   - Created `/api/receipts/google-ocr/route.ts` endpoint
   - Added `GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY` environment variable to Vercel
   - Better OCR accuracy and cost efficiency for receipt scanning

2. **Fixed Glassmorphic Floating Button**
   - Replaced custom div + icon with proper Lucide `Plus` icon
   - Changed scroll threshold from 200px to 50px for immediate response
   - Button now properly shows "+" when scrolled down, "+ Expense" when expanded
   - Added proper glassmorphic effects with backdrop blur and transparency

3. **Implemented Clean Camera-First Receipt UI**
   - Replaced complex multi-step modal with modern 3-step flow:
     1. Landing: "Scan Receipt" vs "Upload Image"
     2. Camera: Full-screen viewfinder with capture button
     3. Review: Receipt image + extracted data with confidence indicators
   - Added camera permission handling and error states
   - Disabled background scrolling when modal is open

4. **Fixed Mobile UI Layout Issues**
   - Added `pb-24` to comments section to prevent floating button overlap
   - Fixed trip header scroll behavior (slides up properly when scrolling)
   - Extended background coverage for mobile layout

### Expected Test Results
When user tests the receipt scanning:

**Glassmorphic Button:**
- ✅ Should show clear "+" icon (not dot)
- ✅ Should animate from "+ Expense" to "+" when scrolling down past 50px
- ✅ Should be positioned bottom-right on mobile with proper backdrop blur effects

**Receipt Scanning Flow:**
- ✅ Tapping glassmorphic button should open clean landing modal
- ✅ "Scan Receipt" should request camera permissions and show live viewfinder
- ✅ Camera should display full-screen with positioning guidance
- ✅ Capture should process with Google Vision API and show review screen
- ✅ Review should display confidence indicators (green/yellow/red dots)
- ✅ Background should not scroll when modal is open

**Mobile Layout:**
- ✅ No gap between headers when scrolling
- ✅ Trip header should slide up smoothly
- ✅ Bottom padding should prevent content cut-off above floating button

### Known Issues to Verify
1. **Camera Permissions**: Ensure browser prompts for camera access properly
2. **OCR Processing**: Verify Google Vision API integration works with new key
3. **Button Animation**: Confirm smooth transition between collapsed/expanded states
4. **Mobile Scrolling**: Check that background scroll lock works properly

### Next Steps (If Issues Found)
- Test camera functionality on actual mobile device
- Verify Google Vision API quota and billing
- Fine-tune glassmorphic effects if needed
- Adjust scroll thresholds if animation timing feels off

### Technical Details
- **Google Vision API**: Uses DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION for better receipt parsing
- **Camera API**: Uses `facingMode: 'environment'` for rear camera on mobile
- **Scroll Detection**: Listens to window.scrollY with 50px threshold
- **Modal Architecture**: Progressive state machine (landing → camera → review)
