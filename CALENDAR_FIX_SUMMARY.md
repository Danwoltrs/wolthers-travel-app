# OutlookCalendar Activity Display Fix

## Problem Identified
The OutlookCalendar component was not displaying saved activities due to complex and error-prone filtering logic in the `TimeSlotComponent` (lines 582-682).

## Root Causes Fixed

### 1. **Complex Time Parsing Issues**
- **Problem**: Lines 606-623 had complex time parsing that handled multiple formats poorly
- **Solution**: Created `parseActivityHour()` helper function with simplified HH:MM parsing
- **Result**: Reliable parsing of time strings with proper error handling

### 2. **Overly Complex Hour Matching**
- **Problem**: Lines 625-630 had convoluted logic for single-day vs multi-day activities
- **Solution**: Created `shouldActivityShowInSlot()` function with clear logic separation
- **Result**: Activities now correctly appear in their designated time slots

### 3. **Date Matching Problems**
- **Problem**: Lines 631-646 had complex date range checks that were failing
- **Solution**: Created `isActivityOnDate()` function with simplified date matching
- **Result**: Both single-day and multi-day activities show on correct dates

## Key Changes Made

### Simplified Filter Logic
```typescript
// OLD: 100+ lines of complex filtering
const slotActivities = activities.filter(activity => {
  // Complex time parsing, date matching, and hour logic...
})

// NEW: Clean, debuggable logic
const slotActivities = activities.filter(activity => {
  if (!activity.start_time) return false
  
  const activityHour = parseActivityHour(activity.start_time)
  if (activityHour === null) return false
  
  if (!isActivityOnDate(activity, date.dateString)) return false
  
  return shouldActivityShowInSlot(activity, activityHour, timeSlot.hour, date.dateString)
})
```

### New Helper Functions
1. **`parseActivityHour(timeString)`** - Robust time parsing
2. **`isActivityOnDate(activity, targetDate)`** - Simplified date matching  
3. **`shouldActivityShowInSlot(...)`** - Clear time slot logic

### Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added comprehensive activity summary logging
- Specific logging for test activities (Randy pickup, Santos drive, Bourbon meeting)
- Better error tracking for parsing failures
- Real-time filtering status for key activities

## Expected Results

### Test Cases That Should Now Work:
- ✅ Randy pickup from GRU at 5am Sep 16 should appear on calendar
- ✅ Drive to Santos Sheraton Hotel should appear  
- ✅ Bourbon meeting in Poços de Caldas should display
- ✅ All saved activities (showing as 13 in statistics) should be visible

### Debugging Features:
- Console logs show activity parsing and filtering decisions
- Debug summary displays activities overview on component mount
- Real-time logging for specific test activities
- Clear error messages for unparseable times

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/dashboard/OutlookCalendar.tsx` - Complete refactor of filtering logic

## Testing Instructions
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to trip with saved activities
3. Open browser console to see debug logs
4. Verify activities appear in correct time slots
5. Check that all 13 saved activities are visible on calendar

The calendar should now reliably display all saved activities with proper time slot positioning and comprehensive debugging capabilities.
