# Tomorrow Session Info - January 16, 2025

## üéØ **What We Accomplished Today**

### **Primary Achievement: Email Rate Limiting & Advanced Templates Integration** ‚úÖ

We successfully resolved a complex git merge conflict situation where our local rate limiting improvements needed to be combined with advanced email template improvements from the remote repository. The result is a comprehensive, production-ready email system.

## üìß **Email System Status - FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

### **Rate Limiting Solution (SOLVED YOUR MAIN PROBLEM)** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Only one email being sent due to Resend API rate limits (100 emails/month on free tier)
- **Solution**: Implemented intelligent delays and retry logic
  - 1-second delays between emails to prevent rate limiting
  - 10-second retry backoff if rate limited
  - Individual sending for large batches (>3 recipients)
  - Exponential backoff with comprehensive error handling

### **Email Templates Now Available** ‚úÖ
1. **Trip Itinerary**: Beautiful responsive HTML with daily activities, logistics, emergency contacts
2. **Host Meeting Requests**: Professional card design with accept/decline/reschedule buttons
3. **Guest Itinerary**: Complete travel details with accommodation and transportation info
4. **Meeting Response Notifications**: Automated organizer notifications with actionable next steps

### **Auto-Save System** ‚úÖ
- **Your Question**: "Keep auto-save then, but fix it so it works with picking off where we left off"
- **Status**: FIXED - Trip restoration now works properly from stepData
- **Enhancement**: Fixed authentication flow from localStorage to httpOnly cookies

### **Email Testing Infrastructure** ‚úÖ
- **Your Request**: "Create an api to test e-mail sending too"
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Available**: `/src/app/api/emails/test/route.ts` API + `/src/app/admin/email-test/page.tsx` UI
- **Features**: Test all 7 email templates individually or as batch, admin-only access

## üöÄ **What's Ready for Tomorrow**

### **Email System - Production Ready**
- All email functions now use consistent `trips@trips.wolthers.com` sender address
- Rate limiting automatically applied to all sending functions
- Professional templates with responsive design
- Complete testing framework for development and debugging

### **Trip Creation Workflow**
- Auto-save restoration working properly
- Authentication flow secure with httpOnly cookies
- Multi-step trip creation process functional
- Database integration stable

### **Key APIs Working**
- Email testing: `POST /api/emails/test`
- Trip continuation: `GET /api/trips/continue/[accessCode]`
- Progressive save: `POST /api/trips/progressive-save`
- Wolthers staff: `GET /api/users/wolthers-staff`

## üîß **If You Want to Test Tomorrow**

### **Email System Testing**
```bash
# Start the app
npm run dev

# Navigate to email testing (admin only)
http://localhost:3000/admin/email-test

# Or test via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/emails/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"emailType": "trip_creation", "recipients": ["test@example.com"]}'
```

### **Auto-Save Testing**
1. Start creating a trip
2. Fill out some steps (should auto-save every 30 seconds)
3. Navigate away or close browser
4. Return to dashboard and click "Continue" on the draft
5. Should restore exactly where you left off

## üìã **Files Modified Today (Summary)**

### **Core Email System**
- `src/lib/resend.ts` - Rate limiting + advanced templates (merged)
- `src/app/api/emails/test/route.ts` - Email testing API
- `src/app/admin/email-test/page.tsx` - Testing UI
- `src/app/trips/continue/[accessCode]/page.tsx` - Auto-save restoration

### **Rate Limiting Implementation**
- Added delay functions to prevent API rate limits
- Individual email sending for large recipient lists
- Intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### **Template System**
- Professional HTML email templates with responsive design
- Meeting management system with response handling
