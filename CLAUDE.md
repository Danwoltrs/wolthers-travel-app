- `npm run db:reset` - Reset the database to initial state

## Architecture

This is a Next.js 15 application with TypeScript, built for travel itinerary management. Key architectural components:

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4 with React 19 and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 (downgraded from v4 for stability)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with realtime capabilities)
- **Authentication**: Azure MSAL for Microsoft auth integration, NextAuth
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic SDK and OpenAI SDK
- **Email**: Nodemailer for email notifications
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Utilities**: clsx and tailwind-merge for className management

### Project Structure
- `/src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `/src/components/` - Reusable React components
  - `/dashboard/` - Dashboard-specific components (TripCard, QuickViewModal)
  - `/layout/` - Layout components (Header)
- `/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `/src/lib/` - Utility functions and shared logic
  - `utils.ts` - Common utilities including date formatting with day names
- `/src/services/` - External service integrations (API clients, etc.)
- `/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/supabase/migrations/` - Database migration files

### Key Features
- Travel itinerary management system for Wolthers & Associates
- Integration with Microsoft authentication via Azure MSAL
- AI-powered features using Anthropic Claude and OpenAI
- Real-time database capabilities with Supabase
- Email notification system

### Design System

#### Color Palette
- **Primary Green**: Deep forest green for headers and navigation (`#2D5347` range)
- **Gold Accents**: Warm golden tones for card sections and highlights (`#FEF3C7`, `#F3E8A6`)
- **Neutral Grays**: Clean gray scale from light backgrounds to charcoal text
- **Supporting**: Cream backgrounds and sage green for status indicators

#### Component Design

##### Header
- Fixed glassmorphic green navigation bar
- Icon-only design with rounded pill shape
- Semi-transparent background with backdrop blur

##### TripCard  
- Fixed 420px height with three-section layout
- Gold-toned title sections for visual hierarchy
- Consistent spacing and progress indicators
- Clean typography with proper text truncation

#### Design Philosophy
Nordic minimalism meets corporate travelâ€”professional, trustworthy, and visually clean. The forest green anchors the brand while gold accents add warmth and guide attention.

#### Typography
- Danish minimalist aesthetic with clean, readable fonts
- Consistent use of text sizes: `text-lg` for titles, `text-sm` for content
- Proper text truncation with ellipsis for long content

### TypeScript Configuration
- Strict mode enabled for type safety
- JSX preserve mode for Next.js compatibility
- ES2016 target with DOM libraries
- Module resolution set to Node

### UI/UX Principles
1. **Consistency**: All cards maintain the same height (420px) for visual uniformity
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Color-coded sections guide the eye through important information
3. **Minimalism**: Danish-inspired design with purposeful use of white space
4. **Accessibility**: Proper color contrast and hover states for all interactive elements
5. **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts

- Follow TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Ensure responsive design across all screen sizes
- Use Lucide icons exclusively for visual consistency
- Keep glassmorphic effects subtle and professional
