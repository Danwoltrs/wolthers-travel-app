# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start Next.js development server
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm run start` - Start the production server

### Database
- `npm run db:start` - Start Supabase local development environment
- `npm run db:stop` - Stop Supabase local development environment
- `npm run db:reset` - Reset the database to initial state

## Architecture

This is a Next.js 15 application with TypeScript, built for travel itinerary management. Key architectural components:

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4 with React 19 and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 (downgraded from v4 for stability)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with realtime capabilities)
- **Authentication**: Azure MSAL for Microsoft auth integration, NextAuth
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic SDK and OpenAI SDK
- **Email**: Nodemailer for email notifications
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Utilities**: clsx and tailwind-merge for className management

### Project Structure
- `/src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `/src/components/` - Reusable React components
  - `/dashboard/` - Dashboard-specific components (TripCard, QuickViewModal)
  - `/layout/` - Layout components (Header)
- `/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `/src/lib/` - Utility functions and shared logic
  - `utils.ts` - Common utilities including date formatting with day names
- `/src/services/` - External service integrations (API clients, etc.)
- `/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/supabase/migrations/` - Database migration files

### Key Features
- Travel itinerary management system for Wolthers & Associates
- Integration with Microsoft authentication via Azure MSAL
- AI-powered features using Anthropic Claude and OpenAI
- Real-time database capabilities with Supabase
- Email notification system

### Design System

#### Color Palette
- **Primary Green**: Emerald shades for header glassmorphism (`emerald-800`, `emerald-700`, `emerald-600`)
- **Gold/Cream Accents**: `amber-50` for trip card titles, `amber-100/50` for company sections
- **Neutral Grays**: Pearl shades (`pearl-100` to `pearl-900`) for text and borders
- **Status Colors**: `amber-400` for progress bars

#### Component Design

##### Header
- Fixed position glassmorphic green pill design
- Icon-only navigation with hover tooltips
- Backdrop blur effect with semi-transparent background
- Responsive rounded-full container with gradient overlay

##### TripCard
- Fixed height of 420px for uniformity
- Three distinct sections:
  1. Title section with gold/cream background (`bg-amber-50`)
  2. Thin progress bar showing trip completion status
  3. Company section with light brown background (`bg-amber-100/50`)
- Consistent spacing and heights for all content sections
- Date formatting shows day names without year (e.g., "Mon 15 Mar - Fri 20 Mar")

#### Typography
- Danish minimalist aesthetic with clean, readable fonts
- Consistent use of text sizes: `text-lg` for titles, `text-sm` for content
- Proper text truncation with ellipsis for long content

### TypeScript Configuration
- Strict mode enabled for type safety
- JSX preserve mode for Next.js compatibility
- ES2016 target with DOM libraries
- Module resolution set to Node

### UI/UX Principles
1. **Consistency**: All cards maintain the same height (420px) for visual uniformity
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Color-coded sections guide the eye through important information
3. **Minimalism**: Danish-inspired design with purposeful use of white space
4. **Accessibility**: Proper color contrast and hover states for all interactive elements
5. **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts

- Enhanced date formatting to include day names without year
- Removed dashboard title for cleaner interface
- Added thin progress bars between title and company sections
